nov 25 26	start of writing notes

fixed reworked player collisions with bullets
made frame and second counter in debug info
made sprite for shield item
added more enemies to the room steps

need to make enemy collisions with player
new enemies shoot in circular pattern with bool variable that defines direction cw/ccw
			move down from top move back and forth shoot big laser
			basic enemy shoot in X, big collumn of them?
make sprites for them
make shield function and make sprite that overlays on player and spawn first one between first and second basic shot item

need to be more enemy patterns that arent simply home to player and shoot
